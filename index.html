    <p>A <strong>quark</strong> is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. 
        Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. 
        All commonly observable matter is composed of <strong>up quarks</strong>, <strong>down quarks</strong> and <strong>electrons</strong>. 
        Owing to a phenomenon known as <strong>color confinement</strong>, quarks are never found in isolation; 
        they can be found only within <strong>hadrons</strong>, which include <strong>baryons</strong> (such as protons and neutrons) and <strong>mesons</strong>, or in <strong>quarkâ€“gluon plasmas</strong>.
        For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of hadrons.
